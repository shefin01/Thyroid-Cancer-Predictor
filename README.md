# 🧪 Thyroid Cancer Prediction – Machine Learning Project

A predictive ML system to assess the likelihood of thyroid cancer using patient medical data. Designed to support early diagnosis with a clean, user-friendly interface.

---

## 💻 What It Does
- Predicts thyroid cancer risk based on user input
- Built with an **XGBoost model (80.4% accuracy, 91% precision on positives)**
- Interactive web interface using **Streamlit**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- Streamlit  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for EDA)

---

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed nulls, handled outliers, encoded features  
2. **EDA**: Analyzed distributions, feature relationships  
3. **Modeling**: Compared multiple classifiers; XGBoost performed best  
4. **Deployment**: Live prediction via Streamlit interface
