# 🧪 Thyroid Cancer Prediction – Machine Learning Project

A predictive ML system to assess the likelihood of thyroid cancer using patient medical data. Designed to support early diagnosis with a clean, user-friendly interface.

---

## 💻 What It Does

- Predicts thyroid cancer risk based on user input  
- Built with an **XGBoost model (80.4% accuracy, 91% precision on positives)**  
- Interactive web interface using **Streamlit**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**  
- **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**  
- **Streamlit**  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for EDA)

---

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning** – removed nulls, handled outliers, encoded features  
2. **EDA** – analyzed distributions, feature relationships  
3. **Modeling** – compared classifiers, selected XGBoost  
4. **Deployment** – built and deployed Streamlit app

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- Real-time risk prediction with clear output  
- User-friendly symptom input form  
- Medical-friendly, interpretable results
