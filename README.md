## 💻 What It Does
- Predicts the risk of thyroid cancer based on user inputs
- Uses a Random Forest model for high accuracy
- Features an interactive web interface built with **Streamlit**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Streamlit  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for EDA)

---

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed nulls, handled outliers, and encoded categorical features  
2. **EDA**: Explored feature relationships and class imbalance  
3. **Modeling**: Tested Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest  
4. **Deployment**: Built a real-time prediction interface with Streamlit
